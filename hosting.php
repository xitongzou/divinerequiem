    </strong><br>
Divine Requiem also offers hosting services for growing sites. Here are the rules if you would like to get hosted: <br>
<br>
1. No porn/hentai/other such sites or sites used solely for the purpose of hosting arbitrarily large files like mp3s, etc. <br>
2. You must have an impressive, original looking site. This means that you must already have a site made, and give me a link to it for consideration. <br>
3. You must be older than 13. The reason for this is that I require mature hostees. <br>
4. You must have decent graphics/design skills. <br>
5. Be nice, and contact me often, through MSN or email. <br>
6. Update often, at least every few weeks to a month. <br>
<br>
<strong>Space Quotas </strong><br>
The amount of space I give you will depend on what type of site you have and how much content you provide. Generally, Blogs/Personal sites and fanlistings will get a bit less space than anime fansites/shrines or graphics sites. I will generally allot between 10 - 50mb for you, and will extend upon that if you ask nicely. <br>
<br>
<strong>Benefits </strong><br>
If you are accepted, you will receive: <br>
1. Subdomain <br>
2. PHP/MySQL support <br>
3. CGI bin <br>
4. An Email account <br>
5. FTP support <br>
<br>
Generally, any type of site (excluding those mentioned in #1) is welcome, and please don't abandon it or go on year-long hiatuses. I hate those types of sites. Once you are aware of that, just fill <br>
out this <a href="http://divinerequiem.net/contact.php" onClick="window.open('contact.php','1932','width=500,height=375,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,scrollbars=no, status=no,toolbar=no,resizable=yes,left=0,top=0, screenx=50,screeny=50');return false">Contact Form </a> and I will consider you. <br>
<br>
<strong>Sponsering services </strong><br>
I also offer sponsering, and the same rules as above apply. Remember to credit me or link to me on your site. Specify how much space when you email me. </span> </td>
