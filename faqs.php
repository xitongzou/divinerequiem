	<td colspan="2" align="left" bordercolor="#070E12" class="row1"><span class="genmed">Q: Where did you get the name Gofishus/Proximus? <br>
A: I actually stole it off one guy from the DBZGTLegacy forums, <br>
his name was Gofishus Maximus and I thought it was kinda cool so ever since, I've been using Gofish, or Gofishus. Proximus was a completely original name i used to play gunbound but have since grown attached to. <br>
<br>
Q: Where did the name Divine Requiem come from? <br>
A: Divine means blessed by God/celestial beings and Requiem is a lament played after the dead. Hence, the terms taken together means blessed lament to the dead. <br>
<br>
Q: Why did you decide to make a Divine Requiem a forum-only site? <br>
A: Explained in <a href="http://www.divinerequiem.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=8">Site Info </a> section. <br>
<br>
Q: How long have you been interested in HTML &amp; Anime? <br>
A: Ever since I was 12, I've been reading html and watching/dling <br>
anime episodes. <br>
<br>
Q: What are your favorite animes? <br>
A: Rurouni Kenshin, Evangelion, Naruto, Love hina, Gundam Seed, etc. <br>
I have alot =P. <br>
<br>
Q: Can I request an anime to be reviewed? <br>
A: Sure, just use the contact form or talk to me on msn and I can probably do it. <br>
<br>
Q: Why does your site take a long time to load? <br>
A: Probably because of the Flash content. <br>
<br>
Q: Why aren't you on AIM that much? <br>
A: Because I don't like AOL and I rarely talk on it anyways. <br>
<br>
Q: Can I be part of the staff? <br>
A: Yes! Just use the contact form and tell me what you will do and how you will benefit me and I'll tell you if you can help me. I will give you full credit on any sections you do. <br>
<br>
Q: How big is your site, and how popular is it? <br>
A: Depends on how many people decide to post, and how frequently. <br>
<br>
Q: Can I be an affiliate? <br>
A: Sure, just apply at the main page. <br>
<br>
Q: Where's the link exchange? <br>
A: I've decided that it was unnecesary and removed it. <br>
<br>
Q: Do you accept sites that use geocities/angelfire/etc <br>
A: No. The reason for this is that I hate sites with popups and besides, with only 10 or 20 mb of space they give you, its not likely to be a great site. Its not that hard to find a free hosting site like kylosa which doesn't give you annoying advertisements. <br>
<br>
Q: Why don't you put text on your graphics <br>
A: Because I feel that it ruins the graphics. I only put out natural graphics which then people can use for enter signs, hiatus signs, error signs, etc. <br>
<br>
Q: Why are all the graphics a set size? <br>
A: They can be all resized in fairly good proportion. For example, 800 x 600 is resizeable to 1024 x 768 or 1152 x 864 or 1600 x 1200. Similiarily, Avatars can be resized to something like 60 x 60 if you so choose. Same applies to banners and buttons. <br>
<br>
Q: Can i submit Fanfics/Fanart? <br>
A: Go to the fanfics section, and feel free to do so there. <br>
<br>
Q: Do you do your own layouts, and do you credit people? <br>
A: Most of the time, I do make my own layouts and yes I do credit people. There should be a horizontal scroller on the bottom of the side menu that lists my script sources. <br>
