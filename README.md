Divine Requiem - An Anime Resource Site
=============

Project Summary
=============
Divine Requiem was an anime/graphics community that I created back in high school. It extended from an even older anime resource site called Japanime that I had created before. The goal of the website was to share anime, graphics, avatars, layouts, wallpapers, etc with other people. The site had an integrated forum and once boasted over 1000 members. Unfortunately the site had to be shut down pending my transition to university life.

Technologies used:
=============
The site was designed primarily using HTML and PHP. The splash screen was done in Flash. The site had alot of interactivity, with many elements of dynamic HTML in it; hence Javascript was the main language used for that. Dreamweaver was used as the IDE for JS,HTML & PHP while Flash was the IDE for creating the flash elements on the start page. CuteFTP and Adobe Photoshop were very useful as complimentary web programming tools.

Responsibilities/Roles
=============
I functioned as the webmaster, programmer and graphics artist for this website, as it was entirely done in my spare time. Alot of the Javascript was taken from external resources such as Dynamic Drive.

Project details
=============
This website was meant to be interactive, and as a community meant to propagate the spreading of resources to everyone. Coppermine Gallery was used as a way of having users upload, download and exchange information while PHPBB was a valuable tool for creating forums. Furthermore, PHP-Nuke was an ideal content management system that also links very well with phpbb.
