			<span class="row1"><span class="genmed">Divine Requiem strives to be a unique, ever-growing file hosting/sharing community that sets itself apart from its peers in its approach to interactivity and dynamics. It allows users to contribute their ideas and improvements for the greater good. It is similiar in concept to P2P networks such as Kazaa, Limewire, Emule, etc. except the user doesn't have to be online, and nothing has to be installed. New ideas are engineered and implemented every day, ever reaching for that ultimate goal to serve the community and the public. Uploading is free, and all it takes is to register first! There are essentially three different sections of Divine Requiem: the forum (where the community shares its ideas), the directory (where files and kept), and the interface you now see before you which links the two on a convenient index page.<br />
			<br /> <strong><center>Here are some basic guidlines to follow when uploading:</strong>
			<p>
			-Don't upload anything illegal<br />
			-Don't upload pornography,explicit content, hentai, etc. <br />
			-Each member has a 50 mb quota. <br />
			-No exe files, this is to prevent viruses/trojans <br />
			
			Rule-breakers will be banned, of course. As long as you are aware of that information, go ahead and <a href="http://divinerequiem.net/main/profile.php?mode=register">register</a> and start <a href="http://www.divinerequiem.net/cpg144/upload.php">uploading</a> ^^!
